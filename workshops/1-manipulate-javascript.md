## üèó Prerequisites

1. Be sure **to have a GitHub account**.

If not, you should create a [GitHub account](https://github.com/join) then [add your ssh to your github profile](https://help.github.com/articles/connecting-to-github-with-ssh) for a simpler authentication.

2. **Fork** the repository via `github`

3. **Clone your forked repository** `https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/clear-fashion`

```sh
‚ùØ cd /path/to/workspace
‚ùØ git clone git@github.com:YOUR_USERNAME/clear-fashion.git
```

4. **Open the entry point [./client/index.html](./client/index.html)** in your browser (that loads the `index.js` file)

```sh
# macos cli
‚ùØ open client/index.html
# linux cli
‚ùØ xdg-open client/index.html

# or by double-clicking in your browser files
```

5. **Check the ouput in your browser console** (Use `Ctrl + Shift + J` or `Cmd + Opt + J` to focus to your console devtools)


## üë©‚Äçüíª Just tell me what to do

1. **Solve each `TODO`** inside [./client/index.js](./client/index.js) file with JavaScript
2. Once a TODO is solved, **commit your modification**:

```sh
‚ùØ cd /path/to/workspace/clear-fashion
‚ùØ git add -A && git commit -m "feat(lowest): compute number of products"
```

([why following a commit message convention?](https://dev.to/chrissiemhrk/git-commit-message-5e21)

3. **Commit early, commit often**
4. Don't forget **to push before the end of the workshop**

```sh
‚ùØ git push origin master
```

**Note**: if you catch an error about authentication, [add your ssh to your github profile](https://help.github.com/articles/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/).

10. Check that your codebase works by checking the console output
11. If you need some helps on git commands, read [git - the simple guide](http://rogerdudler.github.io/git-guide/)

### Don't forget:

* DRY - Don't repeat yourself
* DOT - Do One Thing
* KISS - Keep It Simple Stupid
* LIM - Less Is More
* English only: codebase, variables, comments...

**Focus only on coding, forgot the browser display (next workshop!).**

**Use console.log or [console.table](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Console/table) to display results (for the moment)**
